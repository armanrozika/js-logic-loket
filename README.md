# js-logic-loket
js function for ticket buying

This is the second project for loket.com assignment

I am using vanilla JS for this project. You can check it live at https://armanrozika.github.io/js-logic-loket/

There's a phone input on the page that drop down and user can choose the country phone code. I am using someone else's ready made list for the country code. There's a github page that provide json data for country code, so I fetch that page to get the data.
